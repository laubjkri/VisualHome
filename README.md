# VisualHome
This project is my first self-made full stack application.
The application should be able to function as a home automation application.
The primary focus is on data collection and visualization,
but in the future it might expand to having control functions.

## Planned features
The final project should have these features
- User authentication and authorization
- User settings
- Sensor data via MQTT broker
- Realtime data with visualization
- Historical data using MYSQL
